# Diabetes-Prediction

## Project Idea
### Motivation
<!-- Describe here why this project is being done. -->
Diabetes is a very common disease nowadays. Ignoring a healthy lifestyle is the main reason for this disease. The project's aim is to know about the status of this disease at any time, at any place.
### Scope
<!-- Describe the domain space of the project. -->
This predictive system can be used in the health sector.
### Platform
<!-- What is the environment requirement of the project? What is the OS? Is it for mobile, web, or general API? -->
The project is done using Python in the Windows operating system. It is for the web.  
### Project Brief
<!-- Describe the project in brief. -->
• The Diabetes Prediction application is an end-user support and online consultation project. 

• Here, a web application is proposed that allows users to get instant guidance on their diabetes disease through an intelligent system online.

• The application is fed with various details and the diabetes disease associated with those details.

• The application allows user to share their health-related issues. 

• It then processes user-specific details to check if the user is having diabetes or not.

• Here, the Logistic Regression model is used to predict diabetes. 

• The accuracy of the model is 78.57%.

• Software requirements of this project are Python, Anaconda, IDE, and Web Browser.

• Python libraries and frameworks used in the case of the project are Pandas, Numpy, Sklearn, and Django.

• The system can be used in case of emergency.

This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.
